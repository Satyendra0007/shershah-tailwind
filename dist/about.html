          became
          constituent unit of Magadh University. In
          1992 after the setup of Veer Kunwar Sigh University, this college became the constituent unit of it. I
          rejoined this college after 12 years, in May’2007. At that time condition of college was so pathetic that
          concurrent VC Dr. I.C Kumar had shown deep grieve for disreputable pathetic condition of this college. Special
          official of Rajya Bhawan Dr K Kumar ji shared the same opinion for this college. Present Huge magnificent
          structure is a result of construction & renovation of facilities done after June 2007. In between this ,
          floors of old building, gates, windows and old plasters been renovated and modified to new form along with
          construction of new building of 50000 sqft area in ground floor. Along with this in first floor construction
          work of vitrified tiles floor of 16000 been accomplished for imparting new vocational courses in this floor. I
          am glad that from the beginning this college remains be the center of attraction for the backward and poor
          classes. Numbers of male & female in this college in term of percentage is about 30 to 35 and numbers of alone
          female students forms 30% of total numbers of all the students of this college. To impart the study of
          vocational courses like BBA BBE,BBS and industrial fish & fisheries and library science permission and
          guidance of well renowned professors , noble and experienced faculties of top universities already been
          availed. </p>

          industry. Major languages spoken in this region
          are Bhojpuri, Hindi, and Urdu; local religions include Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism </p>

          Magadh
          University Bodh Gaya (Bihar). It is
          registered under 2(f) and 12 B of U.G.C. The college is located in a poor and backward region of Bihar. A rain
          shadow area where poverty and illiteracy are prominent features of the locality. The majority population of
          this district is SC, ST and OBC. They are either landless or marginal/small farmers with few exceptions. The
          economic disparity is the root cause of left extremism.</p>



        <p class="p-2 text-justify tracking-wide md:p-0">You are aware that college heritage blessed with the shadow of
          two
          great personalities; they are not only the
          pride of the Bihar but also the proud of the world. Whole world believes in an extraordinary talent of Sher
          Shah Suri. He was the man who experiment the public welfare administrative system in India for the first time.
          As there were many emperor ruled in India but the systematization of society in new form is an extraordinary
          example set by Sher Shah Suri. This is a matter of pride that Sher Shah chose Sasaram as its capital. Today,
          group of educationists & learned people discussing new approaches, theories and implementing new
          projects/plans for the establishment of welfare administrative system but 500 years back Sher shah
          experimented and shown the real picture of welfare state. Today’s projects like Construction of the road,
          plantation of trees, facilities for drinking reminds us of Sher Shah Suri. Now it rests in our hand to carry
          forward the pride saga of efficient and talented emperor Sher Shah Suri. College story not ends here. This
          college is an integral part of Veer Kunwar Singh University. There is an intimate relationship between Veer
          Kunwar Singh and struggle movement for the freedom of India. Now it is a duty of the college to carry forward
          the pride of freedom fighter that devoted everything for the nation.

        <p class="p-2 text-justify tracking-wide md:p-0">Sasaram is a city and a notified area in Rohtas district in the
          state of Bihar, India. Sasaram is the birthplace of the Afghan king Sher Shah Suri, who ruled over Delhi, much
          of northern India, what is now Pakistan, and eastern Afghanistan for five years, after defeating the Mughal
          Emperor Humayun. Many of Sher Shah Suri’s governmental practices were adopted by the Mughals and the British
          Raj including taxation, administration, and the building of a paved road from Kabul to Bengal. </p>

        <p class="p-2 text-justify tracking-wide md:p-0"> Sher Shah Suri’s 122 feet (37 m) red sandstone tomb, built in
          the
          Indo-Afghan style stands in the middle of an artificial lake at Sasaram. It borrows heavily from the Lodhi
          style, and was once covered in blue and yellow glazed tiles indicating an Iranian influence. The massive free
          standing dome also has an aesthetic aspect of the Buddhist stupa style of the Mauryan period. The tomb of Sher
          Shah’s father Hasan Khan Suri is also at Sasaram, and stands in the middle of green field at Sherganj, which
          is known as Sukha Rauza. About a kilometer to the North West of Sher Shah’s tomb lies the incomplete and
          dilapidated tomb of his son and successor, Islam Shah Suri. Sasaram also has a baulia, a pool used by the
          emperor’s consorts for bathing. </p>

        <p class="p-2 text-justify tracking-wide md:p-0">The fort of Sher Shah Suri at Rohtasgarh is in Sasaram. This
          fort has
          a history dating back to the 7th century AD. It was built by Raja Harishchandra in the name of his son

          Ganesh temple, diwan-e khas, diwan-e-aam, and various other structures dating back to different centuries. The
